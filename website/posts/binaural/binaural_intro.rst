Binaural Listening
==================

Two-ear (binaural) listening encodes information on the direction and distance
of a sound source by several cues. Figure 1 shows a listener with a sound source and its
properties azimuth elevation and distance.

**Interaural cues** are based on the signal of both ears,
more precisely their differences. They are in particular relevant for the horizontal Localization,
respectively the azimuth:

- interaural time differences (medium frequencies)
- interaural level differences (high frequencies)
- interaural phase differences (low frequencies)


In addition to the interaural cues, the **coloration** gives information on the elevation of
a sound source, as well as on opposing azimuth angles which have identical interaural cues.

Binaural Recording Technology
=============================


Dummy Head
----------

Dummy Head recordings use the principles of binaural listening with two microphones and a
model head, carrying these microphones at the position of the ear drum.

When the dummy head is placed in any environment, it *listens* and records the signals of both ears to two channels.

Many binaural records were released during the 1970s, yet without larger success.

In Ear Microphones
------------------



-----

With the increased use of in ear headphones and streaming, binaural techniques became more and more popular
in the 2010s. ASMR artists, for example, use close-up binaural recordings to create intimate
