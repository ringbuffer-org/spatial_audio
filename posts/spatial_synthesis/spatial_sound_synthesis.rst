Spectral Spatialization
=======================

Spectral spatialization is an advanced form of spatialization, which is based on a separation of
audio signals into frequency bands (Kim-Boyle, 2008).
These frequency bands can be distributed in space which allows a dynamic spreading of existing
sound material.
Spectral spatialization methods are found in many electroacoustic compositions and
live electronic performances.

Spatial Sound Synthesis
=======================

Spatial sound synthesis refers to spatialization at an early stage in the synthesis process.
In contrast to classic spatialization of existing sources,
this results in spatially distributed sounds.
Approaches towards spatial sound synthesis have been presented for most known synthesis
principles, including additive synthesis (Topper, 2002), granular synthesis (Roads, 2004),
physical modeling (Mueller, 2009) and modulation synthesis (McGee, 2015).
