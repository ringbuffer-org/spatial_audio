With FM synthesis (see `CMB: A Brief History <link://slug/a-brief-history>`_ ), John Chowning
invented a wide spread synthesis technique, which was used extensively in 1980s pop music.
When exploring this novel technique, he also lay the foundation for computer-based audio
spatialization.
With *Music 10*, a descendant of Max Mathews MUSIC IV, Chowning was able to create four-channel
compositions with programmed movements of virtual sound sources.
This object-based approach is still used in most cases today.


Algorithm
---------

In *Turenas* (1972), source movements are enhanced with Doppler shift and the
proper handling of the direct-to-reverb ratio:

		*Displaced circular movement with Doppler shift and reverberation (Chowning, 2011).*

The above presented technique was used with Lissajous movements, which are characteristic
for *Turenas*:
