Spatialization Concepts
=======================


Klangm端hle
----------

The *Klangm端hle* was an early electronic device for spatialization, allowing the
panning between different channels by moving a crank, which was then mapped to multiple variable resistors.

Rotationstisch
--------------

The *Rotationstisch* was used by Karlheinz Stockhausen for his work *Kontakte (1958-60)* (von Blumroeder, 2018).
In the studio, the device was used for producing spatial sound movements on a quadraphonic loudspeaker setup.
This was realized with four microphones in a quadratic setup, each pointing towards a loudspeaker in the center:

The predominant effect of the Rotationstisch is amplitude panning, using the directivity of the loudspeaker and wave guide. In addition,
the spatialization includes a Doppler shift when rotating the loudspeaker. The rotation device can be moved manually, thus allowing to *perform*
the spatial movements and record them on quadraphonic tape:

Kontakte
========

Stockhausen's 1958-60 composition *Kontakte* can be considered a milestone of multichannel music.
It exists as a tape-only version, as well as a version for tape and live piano and percussion.
For the tape part, the *Rotationstisch* was used to create the spatial movements - not
fully captured in this stereo version (electronics only).
Listen to 17'00'' for the most prominent rotation movement in four channels:
