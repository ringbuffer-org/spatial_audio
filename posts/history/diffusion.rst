Following the tradition of Pierre Schaeffer, *Diffusion* refers to the live spatialization of
*tape* music, respectively fixed media content. Typically, the music is played back in a low channel order (e.g. Stereo) and
sent to a large number of loudspeakers using an 'inverted' mixing desk.

The Acousmonium
===============

The GRM (Groupe de Recherche Musicale) Acousmonium is an elaborate loudspeaker setup,
designed for the diffusion of acousmatic music. It is made for touring and was first
presented in Germany at the 1983 “Inventionen” festival by François Bayle.
The system returned to Berlin for the 2008 edition of the SMC, where it was paired with the
large WFS system at TU Berlin's H104:

The BEAST
=========

The *Birmingham Electroacoustic Sound Theater* (BEAST) is a modern version of the Acousmonium approach.
It features 100+ loudspeakers in multiple groups with specific characteristics and purposes:

The BEAST was presented in Berlin at the 2010 Inventionen Festival, when Jonty Harrisson
was guest professor at TU Berlin.
