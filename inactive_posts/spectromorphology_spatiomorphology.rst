Spectral Spatialization
=======================

Spectral spatialization is an advanced form of spatialization, which is based on a separation of
audio signals into frequency bands.
In doing so,


Spatial Sound Synthesis
=======================

Spatial sound synthesis refers to spatialization at an early stage in the synthesis process.
In contrast to classic spatialization of existing sources, this results in spatially distributed sounds.
